00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
This is the story of three Billy goats,
gruff.

3
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.970
Once upon a time, there were three Billy Goat
Brothers who lived on a grassy hillside near

4
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.610
a river. There was little Billy goat, gruff,
middle, billy goat, gruff and great big billy

5
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.220
goat gruff. The largest of all the Billy Goat
Brothers lived happily on their hillside,

6
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.190
spending their days munching grass and
drinking cool water from the river. But then,

7
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.040
one terrible day, they looked around to see
that they had eaten all the grass on the

8
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.790
hillside.

9
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.120
Oh, no.

10
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.090
What will we eat now?

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.890
Cried little Billy goat, gruff.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.780
Don't worry, little brother.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.370
Said Middle Billy. Goat, gruff.

14
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.130
Look across the river. There's a lush meadow
over there filled with delicious grass.

15
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.440
That's right, said Big Billy goat, gruff.

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.920
All we have to do is cross the bridge and we
can eat all the grass we want.

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.310
But crossing the wooden bridge over the river
was dangerous. The Billy Goat Brothers knew

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.100
that an awful, smelly troll lived underneath
the bridge, and his favorite thing to eat in

19
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.190
the whole wide world was Billy Goat.

20
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.320
Who crossed the bridge first?

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.270
Ask great big Billy Goat. Finally, little
Billy Goat, Gruff spoke up.

22
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.970
I will trust the bridge first.

23
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.300
He took a deep breath and trotted down the
hillside. I pity Klopp, Klopp, Klopp when his

24
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.740
hooves on the wooden bridge.

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.290
Ooze that clip Klopp in Oman.

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.810
Pre-match shouted the troll.

27
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.180
Shy. Billy drought dwarf.

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.800
Sid the youngest Billy goat trying to sound
brave.

29
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.220
And going over the river to eat the dwarfs on
the other side.

30
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.910
Oh, no, you're not.

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.420
Said the horrible troll, and he climbed up
onto the bridge. His skin was green and his

32
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.330
nose was long and crooked. He had warts on
his skin and sharp yellow teeth in his mouth.

33
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.450
I'm going to eat you instead.

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.540
Little Billy goat gruff was very scared of
the smelly old troll. But he was also a very

35
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.830
smart billy goat.

36
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.310
I don't think you want to eat me. You see,
I'm the smallest billy goat. I won't make a

37
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.040
very good meal. But if you wait, my old
Nevada mineral billy goat will come along.

38
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.110
He's much bigger than me.

39
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.730
You might cross the bridge.

40
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.040
And so little Billy goat, gruff clip Eddie
Klopp the rest of the way over the bridge and

41
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.350
was soon in the lush meadow on the other side
of the river. The two other Billy Goat

42
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.570
Brothers saw that their youngest brother was
safe. I'll go next, said Middle Billy Goat,

43
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.610
gruff. And off he went across the wooden
bridge. Clipper Klopp. Klopp Cryptic.

44
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.470
Klopp who's glib?

45
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.530
Klopp No more bridge.

46
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.800
Shouted the troll.

47
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.850
It is I middle billy goat gruff.

48
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120
I'm going over the river to join my brother
in the meadow.

49
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.050
The smelly troll climbed up onto the wooden
bridge a second time.

50
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.340
I know you're.

51
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.140
Not. He hissed.

52
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.340
Because I'm going to eat you in state.

53
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.300
It all. Billy Goat Gruff was scared of the
troll, but like his younger brother, he was

54
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.830
also a smart goat.

55
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.490
You could eat me, but you would be making a
mistake if you just wait a short while. My

56
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.900
older brother, great big billy goat, gruff.
He's the biggest of.

57
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.010
All of us and.

58
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.680
Would certainly make the best meal.

59
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.130
He writes.

60
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.740
You might cross the bridge.

61
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.410
And so middle billy goat, gruff flip flop the
rest of the way over the bridge and were soon

62
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.990
in the lush meadow with his younger brother
on the hillside. Great big billy goat gruff

63
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.660
could see that both his brothers had made it
safely across the river. And so off he went

64
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.910
down the hill and onto the wooden bridge.
Clip the clip. Clip Klopp. Clip Klopp.

65
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.300
Proves that. Clip Klopp in my bridge.

66
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.440
Said the troll.

67
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.760
It is I great big billy goat gruff.

68
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.890
I'm going over the river to join my brothers
in the meadow.

69
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.150
The vile troll climbed up onto the wooden
bridge a third time.

70
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.310
Oh, no, you're not.

71
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.940
Because I'm going to wake you and stay dead.

72
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.430
But unlike his younger brother's great big
Billy goat, Gruff was not afraid of the

73
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.430
terrible troll. The large goat stamped his
hooves, lowered his great big horns, and

74
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.290
charged at the troll rash.

75
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.370
He rammed the troll right off the bridge. The
horrible, ugly, smelly troll fell into the

76
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:08.190
river with a great. And so great big billy
goat, gruff clip clop the rest of the way

77
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.110
over the bridge. And we're soon in the lush
meadow with little billy goat, gruff and

78
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.570
middle Billy goat gruff. The three Billy Goat
Brothers spent the rest of their days happily

79
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.110
munching green grass and drinking cool water
from the river. And the ugly troll was never,

80
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.090
ever seen again.

81
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.590
The end.
