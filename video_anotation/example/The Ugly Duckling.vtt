00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.870
The ugly duckling. On a beautiful summer day,
a family of ducks is taking a swim while

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.310
another is enjoying a stroll by the bank. But
one duck is sitting on her eggs among the

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.330
tall leaves.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
I wonder when my babies are going to come
out. They are taking so long to hatch. It is

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.750
so lonely.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.880
No one has the time to visit me.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
Well, Mommy, Duck didn't have to wait too
long. Soon the eggs started cracking and the

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.500
little duckling started taking small,
unsteady steps out of their shells.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.100
Quack, quack, quack, quack. Oh, my babies are
so beautiful. Now, come on. Line up here, all

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.990
of you. One, two, three, four, five.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.360
Hey, there should be one more.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
Mother Duck looked around and saw one egg
which had not yet hatched.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
I think I will have to sit again on this egg
till it hatches. It seems pretty large.

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.540
Soon, the last egg hatched. But the duckling
that crept out was large and ugly.

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.740
This little fellow doesn't look like his
brothers and sisters.

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.190
The next day, mother duck leads her brood to
the water.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.910
Oh, I am proud today that my ducklings are
swimming so well. And how well? The youngest

18
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.830
one is swimming. Come on, kids.

19
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.350
That's enough for today. We must get to the
farm before it turns dark.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.980
The Duck family makes its way to the
farmhouse where there were lots of other

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.610
ducks.

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.960
What is that strange looking creature doing
here?

23
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
The other ducklings are so cute. But this one
is so big and ugly.

24
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.020
He is ugly.

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.670
We don't want him here.

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.240
That's not a nice thing to say. He is still
small and I'm sure he will grow up to be

27
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.590
beautiful too.

28
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
But the other ducklings continue to bully and
make fun of the ugly duckling.

29
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.860
I hope the ducklings stop this nonsense. I
can't bear to see that poor child looking so

30
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.610
sad.

31
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.620
But as days went by, things started becoming
worse for the ugly duckling. Wherever he

32
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.750
went, everyone was mean to him.

33
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.410
Have you ever seen anything uglier than this.

34
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.410
Seeing this creature in the morning? My day
will also be as ugly as he is.

35
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.010
He seems to be getting uglier by the day.

36
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.720
The ugly duckling just wanted to hide
somewhere and cry. Even his brothers and

37
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.090
sisters were rude to him. Mother Duck was
very sad to see everyone treat the ugly

38
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.380
duckling so badly.

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.000
Nobody wants to talk to me or play with me
because I am ugly. I will run away from here.

40
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.680
So the ugly duckling flew over the fence of
the farmyard and continued flying until he

41
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.310
spotted a large moor. He decided to spend the
night there.

42
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.620
I am so tired.

43
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.060
I think I will spend the night here.

44
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.460
Next morning, the ugly duckling woke up to
the sound of loud quacking. He opened his

45
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.500
eyes and saw a flock of wild ducks.

46
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.950
Who are you? What are you doing here?

47
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.270
Can I please stay here for a while? I have
nowhere to go.

48
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.890
You are ugly.

49
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.120
Stay. Don't get in our way.

50
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.950
The ugly duckling stayed on the moor for a
few days. He felt lonely, but no one bullied

51
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.200
him or hurt him because of his looks. One
morning, the duckling heard a noise like a

52
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.740
big bang. He lay still too scared to move.

53
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.870
When he finally lifted his head and looked
around, all of the other ducks had fled. The

54
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.670
ugly duckling also fled from the moor as fast
as it could. It flew as fast as its young

55
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.740
wings would take them. However, suddenly
there was a thunder and lightning scaring the

56
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.610
little duckling.

57
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.300
Per, I am so wet and cold.

58
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.620
That cottage there looks warm. Maybe I can
take shelter there.

59
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.330
The cottage belonged to an old lady who lived
with her tomcat and hen who found the

60
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.620
duckling the next morning.

61
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.840
What is happening here? Why are you making so
much noise?

62
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.750
What is this we have here? Looks like a duck,
though.

63
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.370
A very ugly one.

64
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.550
I know what I will do. I will keep it with me
and wait for it to lay eggs. Then I will have

65
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.900
eggs for my hen.

66
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.270
And from this duck too.

67
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.250
Oh, but I do hope that this is a duck and not
a Drake.

68
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.890
So the ugly duckling stayed with the old lady
in her cottage. But here also the tomcat and

69
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.320
hen made its life so miserable.

70
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.260
Hey, you. Don't you get scared when you see
your face in the mirror? Look at me. My coat

71
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.730
is so silky.

72
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.170
Look at my whiskers. So long and beautiful.
The mistress says my walk is so graceful.

73
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.870
You are such a loser. You cannot even lay an
egg. Look at my eggs. Such lovely, big and

74
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.950
brown ones.

75
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.660
The ugly duckling continued to be lonely. He
would sit in front of the window looking at

76
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.250
the small pond outside.

77
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.910
How I wish I could swim in that pond. And
used to be so nice when I swam in the cool

78
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.320
water back home.

79
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.970
Are you mad?

80
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.190
The mistress isn't going to let you go. You
have a safe house. What more do you want?

81
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.940
Behave yourself and don't anger the mistress,
the cat.

82
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.140
Or even me.

83
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.920
Want to swim?

84
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.110
Indeed.

85
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.520
The ugly duckling felt very, very sad,
wondering what to do.

86
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.330
I know this place is safe, but I feel like a
prisoner here being punished by being not

87
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.780
allowed to swim. I want to swim.

88
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.370
I want to be free to swim and fly as I
please. I have to escape from here somehow.

89
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.370
So one night, the duckling quietly crept out
of the cottage and went in search of a new

90
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.940
home. Soon, he found a beautiful lake where
he could swim and dive.

91
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.170
This is such a lovely place.

92
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.880
Feels so good to swim after so long. I hope
the other animals and birds here are friendly

93
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.070
so I don't have to move away from here also.

94
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.200
But alas, here too. The other animals did not
want to be friends with the ugly duckling.

95
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.010
Why does everybody keep avoiding me? Just
because I'm ugly doesn't mean everyone has to

96
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.240
be mean. No one wants to play with me or even
talk to me.

97
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.460
So life continued in this miserable way for
the ugly duckling. Soon the seasons changed.

98
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.830
Autumn set in and the colour of the leaves
changed from red to orange and then gold.

99
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.430
Winter followed the forest turned white and a
very cold wind set in. The dark clouds made

100
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.870
the duckling feel even more gloomy and sad.
So the duckling decided to go to the

101
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.840
lakeside. And what a lovely sight he saw
there.

102
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.690
What are these beautiful birds? I don't think
I seen them before. How beautifully they

103
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:02.050
spread their large wings. Looks like they are
not flying, but just gliding through the sky.

104
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.210
Though the winter grew colder, the duckling
continued to swim despite the freezing water

105
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.520
and then finally took refuge in some bushes.
Finally, it was spring again. Plants started

106
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.930
sprouting and a sun peep down from the sky.
The duckling was so happy that it was

107
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.070
becoming warm again.

108
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.580
Everything around me has become so beautiful.
My wings have also become strong and I can

109
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.710
now swim in the pond close by.

110
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.520
Suddenly, the duckling once again saw the
same beautiful birds that he had seen at the

111
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.240
start of spring and quickly ran and hid
behind some bushes.

112
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.540
Those birds are so beautiful I better not go
near them or they too will make fun of me.

113
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.820
I'm so scared that they might kill me. I'm so
tired of being picked on by everybody. First

114
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.310
the ducklings at the farm. My own brothers
and sisters, the hen and tomcat at the

115
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.920
cottage and everybody else.

116
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.320
I wish I never been born.

117
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.860
The duckling went to a quiet spot on a lake
where nobody could see him. He was very, very

118
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.290
sad and big, fat tears rolled down its face.
Suddenly the duckling saw its own reflection

119
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.210
in the lake and couldn't believe his eyes for
staring at him in the clear water. Below was

120
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:23.990
his own reflection. No longer a dark grey
bird, ugly and repulsive to look at. Instead,

121
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.240
he had turned into a graceful and beautiful
swan. The ugly duckling had transformed into

122
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.130
a beautiful swan. All of the other swans came
to greet the newcomer and stroked his neck

123
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.360
with their beaks. Finally, the ugly little
thing was accepted and loved by his new

124
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.690
friends to whom he belonged. The beautiful
and graceful swans. A family with two

125
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.880
children, came to see the swan swimming.

126
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.920
Look, there is a new one.

127
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:55.100
Father. Mother, come here. There is another
swan. A new one has arrived. The new one is

128
00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.020
the most beautiful of all. Oh, he is so young
and pretty.

129
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.710
The Swan did not know how to react to so much
praise. He felt shy and tried to hide his

130
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.600
face after being mocked and taunted and
bullied for so long. He couldn't believe he

131
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.850
was being appreciated and accepted and he was
actually being called beautiful.

132
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.730
I never dreamt that I would see a day where
someone would call me beautiful. I wish I had

133
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.070
received the same love and affection when I
was the little and ugly creature. I wouldn't

134
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:34.010
have spent such a sad childhood. Why do
people treat others according to their looks?

135
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.920
That is so, so sad.
