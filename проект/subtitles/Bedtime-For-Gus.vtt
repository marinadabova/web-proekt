00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.400
Bedtime for Gus.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.900
Cinderella looked out her window. The sun was
setting in the distance.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.950
She could see the castle's clock. It read
8:00.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:22.530
Cinderella tapped gently on the walls of her
attic room. Bedtime. She called Jack, Susie,

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.050
Gus and the other mice hurried out of their
mousehole. Cinderella did all the household

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.930
chores in her wicked stepmother's house. She
never had time for fun.

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.960
So the birds and mice were her only friends.
Bedtime already?

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.370
Jack cried.

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.910
The bedtime, Gus asked.

10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.700
Gus was Cinderella's newest mouse friend. She
had just rescued him from a trap that

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.010
morning. Bedtime, Gus.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.470
Gus closed eyes and fell asleep, Susie
explained.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.500
Gus looked confused. He closed his eyes and
started to tip over. Jack caught him not

14
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.050
fall. Gus, Gus, he said.

15
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.430
Fall asleep like this.

16
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.870
He put his head on his hands and pretended to
snore. Cinderella laughed. Falling asleep

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.890
isn't all there is to bedtime, she said. Gus
has never lived in a house before. We'll have

18
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.780
to teach him about getting ready for bed. Oc
oc the other mice cried.

19
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.260
Gus. Gus, first Cinderella said, you have to
put on your pyjamas.

20
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.770
She went to a trunk and pulled out a tiny
pair of striped pajamas for Gus. Here, try

21
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.800
these on. Soon they were all in their
pajamas. Even Cinderella.

22
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.060
That's better, Cinderella declared. Pajamas
are much more comfortable for sleeping than

23
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.790
regular clothes. Gus nodded.

24
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.240
Gus Gus loves pajamas, he explained.

25
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.540
Gus Gus wears pajamas all the time.

26
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.520
Cinderella smiled.

27
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.070
I'm glad you like your pajamas, Gus, but they
are only for while you're sleeping. The mouse

28
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.070
nodded. Now sleep, Cinderella.

29
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.610
Another mouse cried. Cinderella smiled.

30
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.120
Not quite yet, she said to the young mouse.
First, wash your face and brush your teeth

31
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920
when you're all scrubbed and brushed. I'll
kiss you goodnight. And then Susie will tuck

32
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.450
everyone in. The mice began to brush their
teeth.

33
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.500
Gus said with a smile, tasting the minty
toothpaste. The other mice giggled and

34
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.070
finished up. Gus, watch carefully.

35
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.700
Before long, he was done to tuck.

36
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.920
Tuck in? Gus asked.

37
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.730
Jack pulled him toward the wash basin. Not
yet, Gus, Gus, he said. He handed him some

38
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.030
soap. Gus looked puzzled, but he watched as
the other mice washed their faces and patted

39
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.890
themselves dry with old rags. Then he did the
same thing.

40
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.380
When the mice were all neat and clean,
Cinderella kissed them goodnight. It's time

41
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.620
for everyone to go to sleep, she said
sweetly. Follow me. Jack told Gus. He ran to

42
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.410
his little bed and hopped in. Then he pointed
to the bed next to him. That's your bed, he

43
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.520
said. Gus grinned and got under the covers. 
Susie tucked in each of the mice. At the

44
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.390
rally, the mice cried story. Cinderella
smiled.

45
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.640
All right, she said.

46
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.860
Once upon a time there was a young prince who
lived in a beautiful castle. He had

47
00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.520
everything that money could buy fine clothes,
jewels, paintings and more. But something was

48
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.760
missing. He didn't have anyone special to
love. Cinderella continued the story for a

49
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.810
long time.

50
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.660
Each time she tried to stop, the mice beg for
more. After a while, they couldn't keep their

51
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.220
eyes open anymore.

52
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.570
It was just too late when the last mouse had
fallen asleep. Cinderella tiptoed to her own

53
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.690
bed and climbed in, still thinking about her
bedtime story. Dreaming up tales made her

54
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.050
forget her life of chores, at least for a
time. Just then, Gus began to snore.

55
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.840
Cinderella giggled and pulled up her covers.
She glanced once more at the clock on the

56
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.950
castle tower.

57
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.110
It read 11:00.

58
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.920
Oh my! She murmured sleepily.

59
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.630
If the mice had their way, I'd be telling
tales until midnight. Cinderella, snuggled

60
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.720
against her pillow and yawned. If only some
of my stories would come true, she added

61
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.900
sleepily. As Cinderella closed her eyes, the
birds began to sing a lullaby. Soon,

62
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.230
Cinderella was fast asleep, dreaming that
someday she'd meet a handsome prince and live

63
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.030
happily ever after.
